Package: SNPediaR
Title: Query data from SNPedia
Version: 0.0.3
Authors@R: person ("David", "Montaner", email = "david.montaner@gmail.com", role = c ("aut", "cre"))
Description: SNPediaR provides some tools for downloading and parsing data from
    the SNPedia web site <http://www.snpedia.com>.
    The implemented functions allow users to import the wiki text available in
    SNPedia pages and to extract the most relevant information out of them.
    If some information in the downloaded pages is not automatically processed
    by the library functions, users can easily implement their own parsers to
    access it in an efficient way.
